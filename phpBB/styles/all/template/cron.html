{#
	Runs the cron task by triggering server request to the URL on load. `img` is
	preferred over JS to ensure maximum compatibility. We use `class="sr-only"`
	to hide visually and `aria-hidden="true"` to hide from screen-readers; using
	`hidden` or `display: none` would prevent the task from running.

/*
  This first section is optional, however its probably the best method
  of running phpBB on Oracle. If you already have a tablespace and user created
  for phpBB you can leave this section commented out!

  The first set of statements create a phpBB tablespace and a phpBB user,
  make sure you change the password of the phpBB user before you run this script!!

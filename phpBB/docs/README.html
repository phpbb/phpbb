	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="inner"><span class="corners-top"><span></span></span>

		<div class="content">

	<p>Once installed phpBB is easily managed by both admin and moderator control panels. If you need help or advice with phpBB please see <a href="#help">Section 3</a> below.</p>

	<a name="i18n"></a><h3>2.i. Internationalisation (i18n)</h3>

	<p>A number of language packs and style localisations are available. You can find them on our official download page:</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.phpbb.com/downloads/">http://www.phpbb.com/downloads/</a></p>

	<p>This is the <em>official</em> location for all supported language sets. If you download a package from a 3rd party site you do so with the understanding that we cannot offer support. Please do not ask for support if you download a language pack from a 3rd party site.</p>

	<p>Installation of these packages is straightforward; simply download the required language pack and extract it into the <samp>languages/</samp> folder. Please ensure you retain the directory structure when doing this! Once uploaded go to the <code>Admin-&gt;System-&gt;Language Packs</code> and install the new language pack, which will have been automatically detected. To install the style imageset you should download the imageset for your language and extract the file/s into the relevant imageset directory (styles/prosilver/imageset or styles/subsilver2/imageset). Again, you must retain the directory structure. Once installed the imageset will immediately become available.</p>

	<p>If your language is not available please visit our forums where you will find a topic listing translations currently available or in preparation. This topic also gives you information should you wish to volunteer to translate a language not currently listed.</p>

	<a name="styles"></a><h3>2.ii. Styles</h3>

	<p>Although phpBB Group are rather proud of the included styles we realise that it may not be to everyones tastes. Therefore phpBB3 allows other styles to be used with relative ease. First, you need to locate and download a style you like. We maintain such a site at</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.phpbb.com/styles/">http://www.phpbb.com/styles/</a></p>

	<p><strong>Please note</strong> that styles for phpBB2 will <strong>not</strong> work with phpBB3.</p>

	<p>Once you have downloaded a style, the next step is to extract (or upload the extracted contents of) the package into your <samp>styles/</samp> directory. You then need to visit <code>Administration -&gt; Styles</code>. You should see the new style, click install and it will become available for all your users.</p>

	<p><strong>Please note</strong> that if you create your own style or modify existing ones, you should enable the &quot;Recompile stale style components&quot; setting within the <code>Admin-&gt;General-&gt;Load Settings</code> screen. This setting allows the cache to detect changes made to the style and automatically refresh it. If this setting is disabled, you will not see your changes taking effect without manually refreshing the style components.</p>

	<a name="mods"></a><h3>2.iii. Modifications</h3>

	<p>Although the modifications themselves are not officially supported by phpBB Group, phpBB has a thriving modification scene. These add features to phpBB, and can be found at:</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.phpbb.com/mods/">http://www.phpbb.com/mods/</a></p>

	<p><strong>Please remember</strong> that any bugs or other issues that may occur as a result of installing a modification should <strong>NOT</strong> be reported to the bug tracker (see below). First remove the modification, and then see if that has fixed the problem.</p>

	<p>Also remember that any modifications which modify the database in any way may make upgrading your forum to future versions more difficult. However, many users have and continue to utilise many of the mods already available with great success.</p>

<a name="help"></a><h2>3. Getting help with phpBB3</h2>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="inner"><span class="corners-top"><span></span></span>

		<div class="content">

	<p>phpBB3 can sometimes seem a little daunting to new users, particularly with regards to the permission system. The first thing you should do is check the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a>, which covers a few basic getting started questions. If you need additional help there are several places you can find it.</p>

	<a name="docs"></a><h3>3.i. phpBB3 Documentation</h3>

	<p>Comprehensive documentation is now available on the phpBB website:</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.phpbb.com/support/documentation/3.0/">http://www.phpbb.com/support/documentation/3.0/</a></p>

	<p>This covers everything from installation to setting permissions and managing users.</p>

	<a name="website"></a><h3>3.ii. Community Forums</h3>

	<p>phpBB Group maintains a thriving community where a number of people generously donate their time to help support users. This site can be found at:</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.phpbb.com/community/">http://www.phpbb.com/community/</a></p>

	<p>If you do seek help via our forums please be sure to do a search before posting; if someone has experienced the issue before, then you may find that your question has already been answered. Please remember that phpBB is entirely staffed by volunteers, no one receives any compensation for the time they give, including moderators as well as developers; please be respectful and mindful when awaiting responses and receiving support.</p>

	<a name="irc"></a><h3>3.iii Internet Relay Chat</h3>

	<p>Another place you can find help is our IRC channel, which you can find on the Freenode IRC network, <em>irc.freenode.net</em> in <em>#phpbb</em>. It can be accessed by any IRC client such as mIRC, XChat, etc. Again, please do not abuse this service and be respectful of other users.</p>

<a name="status"></a><h2>4. Status of this version</h2>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="inner"><span class="corners-top"><span></span></span>

		<div class="content">

	<p>This is the third stable release of phpBB. The 3.0.x line is essentially feature frozen, with releases only containing fixes for bugs and security issues, though feature alterations and minor feature additions may be done if deemed absolutely required. Our next major release will be phpBB 3.1, which is currently under development. Please do not post questions asking when any future releases will be released; they will be released when they are finished.</p>

	<p>Those interested in the development of phpBB should keep an eye on the forums on the development site, Area51, to see how things are progressing and to help out if you wish:</p>

	<p><a href="http://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/">http://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/</a></p>

	<p>Please note that these forums should <strong>NOT</strong> be used to obtain support, as the main community forums are the place for this. Any such posts will be locked and go unanswered.</p>

<a name="bugs"></a><h2>5. Reporting Bugs</h2>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="inner"><span class="corners-top"><span></span></span>

		<div class="content">

	<p>The phpBB Group uses a bug tracking system to manage all reported bugs, which can be found at the location listed below. Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> post bug reports to our forums, they will be locked. In addition please <strong>DO NOT</strong> use the bug tracker for support requests. Posting such a request will only see you directed to the support forums (while taking time away from working on real bugs).</p>

	<p><a href="http://tracker.phpbb.com/">http://tracker.phpbb.com/</a></p>

	<p>While we very much appreciate receiving bug reports (the more reports the more stable phpBB will be) we ask you carry out a few steps before adding new entries:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>First determine if your bug is reproducible. How to determine this depends on the bug in question. If the bug is reproduceable it is likely to be a problem with phpBB3 (or in some way connected). If it cannot, then it is most likely not a bug in phpBB.<br /><br /></li>
		<li>Next please read or search through the existing bug reports to see whether we already know about the bug you found. If there is already a ticket, then please add to that existing bug rather than creating a new duplicate entry (all this does is slow us down).<br /><br /></li>
		<li>If no existing bug exists then please add it</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you do post a new bug, make sure you are logged in (your username and password are the same as for the community forums) then please include the following details in your bug report:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Your server type/version, e.g. Apache 1.3.28, IIS 4, Sambar, etc.</li>
		<li>PHP version and mode of operation, e.g. PHP 5.1.1 as a module, PHP 4.4.4 running as CGI, etc.</li>
		<li>DB type/version, e.g. MySQL 4.0.1, PostgreSQL 7.3.2, MSSQL Server 2000 SP1, etc.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The relevant database type/version is listed within the administration control panel</p>

	<p>Please be as detailed as you can in your report, and if possible, list the steps required to duplicate the problem. If you have a patch that fixes the issue, please attach it to the ticket or submit a pull request to our repository <a href="https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb3">on GitHub</a>.</p>

	<p>Once a bug has been submitted you will be emailed any follow up comments added to it. If you are requested to supply additional information, <strong>please</strong> do so! It is frustrating for us to receive bug reports, ask for additional information but get nothing. If we cannot replicate the bug we may close the ticket, which could leave the bug in phpBB. Obviously we would rather not have this situation arise.</p>

<a name="securitybugs"></a><h3>5.i. Security related bugs</h3>

	<p>If you find a potential security related vulnerability in phpBB please <strong>DO NOT</strong> post it to the bug tracker, public forums, etc.! Doing so may allow unscrupulous users to take advantage of it before we have time to put a fix in place. All security related bugs should be sent to our security tracker:</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.phpbb.com/security/">http://www.phpbb.com/security/</a></p>

		<div class="content">

	<p>This list is by no means complete but does represent those bugs which may effect users on a wider scale. Other bugs listed in the tracker have typically been shown to be limited to certain setups or methods of installation, updating and/or conversions.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Conversions may fail to complete on large boards under some hosts.</li>
		<li>Updates may fail to complete on large update sets under some hosts.</li>
		<li>Smilies placed directly after bbcode tags will not get parsed. Smilies always need to be separated by spaces.</li>

<a name="php"></a><h2>7. PHP compatibility issues</h2>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="inner"><span class="corners-top"><span></span></span>

		<div class="content">

	<p>phpBB is no longer supported on PHP3 due to several compatibility issues and we recommend that you upgrade to the latest stable release of PHP5 to run phpBB. The minimum version required is PHP 4.3.3. The minimum version that will be required for phpBB 3.1 is PHP 5.3.2.</p>

	<p>Please remember that running any application on a development (unstable, e.g. a beta release) version of PHP can lead to strange/unexpected results which may appear to be bugs in the application. Therefore, we recommend you upgrade to the newest stable version of PHP before running phpBB3. If you are running a development version of PHP please check any bugs you find on a system running a stable release before submitting.</p>

	<p>This board has been developed and tested under Linux and Windows (amongst others) running Apache using MySQL 3.23, 4.x, 5.x, MSSQL Server 2000, PostgreSQL 7.x, Oracle 8, SQLite and Firebird. Versions of PHP used range from 4.3.3 to 6.0.0-dev without problem. </p>

<a name="phpsec"></a><h3>7.i. Notice on PHP security issues</h3>

<p>Currently there are no known issues regarding PHP security.</p>

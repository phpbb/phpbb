# Sample tokenised exception file for phpBB using Sphinx search engine
#
# Exceptions allow one or more tokens to be mapped to a single keyword. 
# Exceptions are defined BEFORE tokenisation and are therefore case sensitive and accept characters that would normally be excluded such as punctuation.
# Exceptions are applied to both indexing and searching, such that search queries for one mapped variation will find all others.
# List needs to be customised according to board and language requirements.
# Please remove all commented lines before use.
#

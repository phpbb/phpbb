// Placeholders can now contain order information, e.g. instead of
// 'Page %s of %s' you can (and should) write 'Page %1$s of %2$s', this allows
// translators to re-order the output of data while ensuring it remains correct

// You do not need this where single placeholders are used, e.g. 'Message %d' is fine
// equally where a string contains only two placeholders which are used to wrap text
// in a url you again do not need to specify an order e.g., 'Click %sHERE%s' is fine

		<h1>How to update your installation with the Automatic Update Package</h1>

		<p>The recommended way of updating your installation listed here is only valid for the automatic update package. You are also able to update your installation using the methods listed within the INSTALL.html document. The steps for updating phpBB3 automatically are:</p>

		<ul style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: 1.1em;">
			<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/downloads/" title="https://www.phpbb.com/downloads/">phpBB.com downloads page</a> and download the "Automatic Update Package" archive.<br /><br /></li>
			<li>Unpack the archive.<br /><br /></li>
			<li>Upload the complete uncompressed "install" and "vendor" folders to your phpBB root directory (where your config.php file is).<br /><br /></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Once uploaded your board will be offline for normal users due to the install directory you uploaded now present.<br /><br />
		<strong><a href="%1$s" title="%1$s">Now start the update process by pointing your browser to the install folder</a>.</strong><br />
		<br />
		You will then be guided through the update process. You will be notified once the update is complete.

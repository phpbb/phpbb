Running Tests
=============

Prerequisites
=============

PHPUnit
-------

phpBB unit tests use PHPUnit framework. Version 3.5 or better is required
to run the tests. PHPUnit prefers to be installed via PEAR; refer to
http://www.phpunit.de/ for more information.

PHP extensions
--------------

Unit tests use several PHP extensions that board code does not use. Currently
the following PHP extensions must be installed and enabled to run unit tests:

- ctype

Database Tests
--------------

By default all tests requiring a database connection will use sqlite. If you
do not have sqlite installed the tests will be skipped. If you wish to run the
tests on a different database you have to create a test_config.php file within
your tests directory following the same format as phpBB's config.php. An
example for mysqli can be found below. More information on configuration
options can be found on the wiki (see below).

    <?php
    $dbms = 'mysqli';
    $dbhost = 'localhost';
    $dbport = '';
    $dbname = 'database';
    $dbuser = 'user';
    $dbpasswd = 'password';

It is possible to have multiple test_config.php files, for example if you
are testing on multiple databases. You can specify which test_config.php file
to use in the environment as follows:

    $ PHPBB_TEST_CONFIG=tests/test_config.php phpunit

Alternatively you can specify parameters in the environment, so e.g. the
following will run phpunit with the same parameters as in the shown
test_config.php file:

    $ PHPBB_TEST_DBMS='mysqli' PHPBB_TEST_DBHOST='localhost' \
      PHPBB_TEST_DBNAME='database' PHPBB_TEST_DBUSER='user' \
      PHPBB_TEST_DBPASSWD='password' phpunit

Running
=======

Once the prerequisites are installed, run the tests from the project root
directory (above phpBB):

    $ phpunit

Slow tests
--------------

Certain tests, such as the UTF-8 normalizer or the DNS tests tend to be slow.
Thus these tests are in the `slow` group, which is excluded by default. You can
enable slow tests by copying the phpunit.xml.all file to phpunit.xml. If you
only want the slow tests, run:

    $ phpunit --group slow

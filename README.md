### 🏗️ Setting up a development build of phpBB

To run an installation from the repo (and not from a pre-built package) on a local server, run the following commands:

- Fork phpbb/phpbb to your GitHub account, then create a local clone of it:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/your_github_name/phpbb.git
  ```
- Install phpBB's dependencies (from the root of your phpbb repo):
  ```
  cd phpBB
  php ../composer.phar install
  ```

Alternatively, you can read:

* Our [Vagrant documentation](phpBB/docs/vagrant.md) to find out how to use Vagrant to develop and contribute to phpBB.
* Our [GitHub Codespaces documentation](phpBB/docs/codespaces.md) to learn about phpBB's cloud-based development environment.

## 📓 Documentation

phpBB's [Development Documentation](https://area51.phpbb.com/docs/dev/index.html) contains all the information you'll need to learn about developing for phpBB's core, extensions and automated testing.

## 🔬 Automated Testing

We have unit and functional tests in order to prevent regressions. You can view the bamboo continuous integration [here](https://bamboo.phpbb.com) or check our GitHub Actions below:
